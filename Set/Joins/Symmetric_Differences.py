# The symmetric_difference() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.
#
# Example
# Keep the items that are not present in both sets:

set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

print(set3)

# Use ^ to join two sets:

set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1 ^ set2
print(set3)

# The symmetric_difference_update() method will also keep all but the duplicates, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.
#
# Example
# Use the symmetric_difference_update() method to keep the items that are not present in both sets:

set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set1.symmetric_difference_update(set2)

print(set1)
